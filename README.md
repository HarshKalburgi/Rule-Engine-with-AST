# Rule-Engine-with-AST
This project implements a simple 3-tier rule engine application using React for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend API, and MongoDB for data storage. The application uses an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent conditional rules and allows for dynamic creation, combination, and evaluation of these rules.
